# UFOs

## Overview of the project:

This project consists of creating a webpage containing the data stored as a JavaScript array or list to create a table organizing the information, using the loop function we can build a table to create a customized dashboard. This webpage is interactive because of its customized filters that can be applied in many ways. The main purpose of this webpage is to present a brief description about the UFO sightings, a table to display all the data, and filters to update the table based on the search criteria. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102932138/202963461-ffee5aaf-bd90-4296-a49d-1a424a94e023.png)

## Summary:

### This webpage has a few drawbacks including:

- Difficulty to know what parameter to use for the filtering. For example, to pick a shape, the user has to go through the table to know what options for the data presented includes. 

- The search field is "case sensitive", it will be challenging for the user to know the reason of why their search is not pulling results, and doesnâ€™t present much flexibility.

- There isn't a click button to clear the filters, it must be done manually.

### Some modifications can be developed to make this webpage more efficient and user friendly:

- Add a dropdown list that presents the filter values in the table.

- Connect the webpage to a live source to have a broader set of data and keep it up to date.
